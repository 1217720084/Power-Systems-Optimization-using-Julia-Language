### Welcome to AC Power Flow Models with Julia Language

This repository aims to share our advances in AC Power Flow Models in order to solve Power Systems Optimization Problems. All of the codes were made in [Julia Language v1.0](https://julialang.org/) using its optimization package [JuMP](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/quickstart/).

JuMP is an open-source modelling language created in [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/). The spirit of JuMP is to serve as optimization plattform for every kind of proffessional in order to solve optimization problems such as linear, non-linear, mixed-integer, convex optimization, etc. There are so many advantages to use Julia & JuMP due to the great communities that are working on developing tools known as **packages**. Actually, there are interfaces to differents **solvers** (open source and commercial); among these are: MINOS, SCIP, CONOPT, CPLEX, MOSEK, IPOPT,  XPRESS, GLPK, etc. 
In addition, this modelling language allows to use familiar functions of differential equations, integrations, statistics, etc. It´s like to mix [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) or [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/erikfilias/JuMP-Julia-Language/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
