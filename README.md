This repository aims to share our advances in AC Power Flow Models that are driven to solve Power Systems Optimization Problems. All of the codes were made in [Julia Language v1.0](https://julialang.org/) using its optimization package [JuMP](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/quickstart/).

JuMP is an open-source modelling language created in [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/). The spirit of JuMP is to serve as optimization plattform for every kind of proffessional in order to solve optimization problems such as linear, non-linear, mixed-integer, convex optimization, etc. There are so many advantages to use Julia & JuMP due to the great communities that are working on developing tools known as **packages**. Actually, there are interfaces to differents **solvers** (open source and commercial); among these are: MINOS, SCIP, CONOPT, CPLEX, MOSEK, IPOPT,  XPRESS, GLPK, etc. 
In addition, this modelling language allows to use familiar functions of differential equations, integrations, statistics, etc. ItÂ´s like to mix [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) or [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/). 

Enjoy it, and give us suggestions!

Best regards!
